Smart Car Project - ENGIN 2223 Microcontrollers

The project purpose was to program a microcontroller using only AVR to control a robot that would follow a curving line of electrical tape autonomously. 
The course would be 2 meters in length. The requirements would be that it needs to complete the course without any assistance in under 20 seconds.
